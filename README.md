# Next.js Rendering Error: Missing or Incorrect Import Statements

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where the application fails to render correctly due to missing or incorrect import statements.  The error might manifest as a blank page, an error message, or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Report

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple Next.js application that should render a basic 'Hello, world!' message. However, the application is missing the necessary import statements required for components or other modules used. As a result, the application either shows an error or renders nothing. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version of the application with the necessary import statements included. Ensure all required components and modules are properly imported to avoid similar issues. Always double-check import paths and ensure the imported modules exist.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. Observe the error in the browser.
5. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` and restart the server to see the corrected output.

This example highlights the importance of accurate import statements for proper Next.js application functionality.
